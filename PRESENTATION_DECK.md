## SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM (30 seconds)

### 🎯 The Challenge We're Solving

**Teachers are drowning in feedback.**

- 📚 100+ students per class
- ⏰ 2-3 weeks to review submissions
- 😞 Students forget context by the time they get feedback
- 🚨 At-risk students go undetected until it's too late
- 💔 Students lose motivation waiting for guidance

**Result**: Broken feedback loop. Students don't improve. Teachers burn out.

## SLIDE 2: THE INSIGHT (20 seconds)

### 💡 What If AI Could Help?

**What if teachers had a co-pilot?**

- ✨ AI analyzes code instantly
- 🎯 Generates personalized feedback in seconds
- 📊 Detects at-risk students automatically
- 🚀 Teachers review 100 submissions in 10 minutes (not 2 hours)
- 🧠 AI learns from teacher edits and gets smarter

**This is not replacing teachers. This is empowering them.**
